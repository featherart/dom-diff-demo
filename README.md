## React Lesson

React is a library for building UI components. It is very simple and lightweight on it's own and cannot be considered a replacement for more comprehensive frameworks such as Ember or Angular. It might be considered the "V" in an MVC architecture.

Features of React that we've probably all heard about:

# 1. Shadow DOM & DOM diffing
# 2. Declarative style of code
# 3. Learn once, write anywhere

We will go into these concepts.
